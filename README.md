# SolarSystemAnimation
This program uses openGL to demonstrate the planets in our solar system rotating around the sun.

Here is the link to the textures used for the planets and sun:

To have the textures visible when running the program, you have to edit the paths in the code
so that they lead to the desired texture on your device.

*NOTE*
Saturn's rings currently not textures correctly.

Here are a few images of what your output should look like.
